Get Modified Files
========================

I created this script for personal use, but could be useful to the community,
It lists all modified files on a given folder and a given start date.

###How to run?

1. Edit the variable dir with the desired base dir
2. Edit the variable fromDate with the desired start date to looking forward
3. Run the the script with in the terminal/prompt like 'node getmodfiles.js'
4. It will generate a text file with the results
