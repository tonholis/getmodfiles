Get Modified Files
========================

I created this script for personal use, but could be useful to the community,
It lists all modified files on a given folder and a given start date.

###How to run?

1. npm install 
2. Edit the 'dir' variable with the desired base dir
3. Edit the 'fromDate' variable with the desired start date to looking forward
4. Run the the script in the terminal like:
	>node getmodfiles.js <output-type>

	/*OUTPUT TYPES*/
    * 'text' will generate a text report with a list of modified files - DEFAULT
    * 'copy' will generate a 'copy' folder with the modified files
    * 'both' will generate a text report and a copy folder
